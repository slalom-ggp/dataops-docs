# [Docs](../README.md) > [Labs](./index.md) > **IAC Intro - Deploying a Data Lake on AWS**

`A Slalom DataOps Lab`

## Lab Objectives

- Create a new repository from an existing template repo.
- Clone and open the new repository on your local workstation.
- Customize the infrastructure and add credentials as needed.
- Use `terraform apply` to deploy the foundations of the core data lake environment, including three S3 buckets, the VPC, and the public and private subnets.

## Setup

- One-time setup:
  - Installed software via:
    1. Core DevOps Tools: [http://docs.dataops.tk/setup](http://docs.dataops.tk/setup)
    2. AWS CLI (optional, for "extra credit" exercises):
        - `choco install awscli` (Windows)
        - `brew install awscli` (Mac)
- Environment setup (each time):
  - Open browser tabs:
    1. The lab checklist (this page)
    2. [Linux Academy Playground](https://playground.linuxacademy.com) - to create the "AWS Sandbox"
    3. [slalom-ggp/dataops-project-template](https://github.com/slalom-ggp/dataops-project-template) - starting point for your new repo

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Create a Repo and a New AWS Account

- [ ] Create new repo from the [Slalom DataOps Template](https://github.com/slalom-ggp/dataops-project-template), clone repo locally and open in VS Code.
- [ ] Get AWS credentials from Linux Academy.
- [ ] Use the linux-academy link to log in to AWS in the web browser.

### Step 2: Configure Credentials

- [ ] In the `.secrets` folder, rename `aws-credentials.template` to `aws-credentials`.
- [ ] Copy-paste your AWS credentials (from Linux Academy Playground) into the correct location within the template.
- [ ] In the `.secrets` folder, rename `aws-secrets-manager-secrets.yml.template` to `aws-secrets-manager-secrets.yml` (no addl. secrets needed in this exercise)

### Step 3: Configure Project

- [ ] Rename `infra-config-template.yml` to `infra-config.yml`
- [ ] Within infra-config.yml, update your email address and your project shortname.

### Step 4: Configure and Deploy Terraform

- [ ] Right-click the `infra` folder and select "Open in Terminal" (or from an existing terminal window, run `cd infra`).
- [ ] In the terminal windows that opens, run `terraform init`.
  - _(Expected wait: 2-5 minutes while modules and providers are downloaded.)_
  - **Optional:** While you are waiting for `terraform init` to complete, you can open the `infra` folder and review the contents of these two files:
    - `00_environment.tf`
    - `01_data-lake.tf`
- [ ] Once `terraform init` has completed, run `terraform apply` in the same terminal window. Review the suggested changes, then type 'yes' to deploy.
- [ ] Wait for `terraform apply` to complete (approx. 2 minutes).
- [ ] In the web browser, browse your AWS console to S3 buckets and confirm the new data lake buckets are created.

### Extra Credit Options

_These bonus exercises are **optional**._

#### EC Option #1: Upload a sample file to the data lake

- [ ] After completing the steps above, go to the output from `terraform apply` (or alternatively you can run `terraform output`) and then copy the provided `AWS User Switch` command.
- [ ] Paste the `AWS User Switch` command into your terminal so that aws-cli can correctly locate your AWS credentials.
- [ ] Upload infra-config.yml to the data bucket: `aws s3 cp ../infra-config.yml s3://...`
- [ ] List the bucket contents with `aws s3 ls s3://...`
- [ ] In the web browser, browse to the bucket and confirm the file has landed.

#### EC Option #2: Spin up Airflow on EC2

- [ ] Copy the contents of the [airflow sample file](https://github.com/slalom-ggp/dataops-infra/blob/main/samples/airflow-on-aws/02_airflow.tf) into a new `.tf` file in the infra folder.
- [ ] Review the airflow module configuration and update the `source` value in the airflow file so that it matches the source prefix for the github repo (replacing the `../..` relative references).
  - _Tip: You can use the file `01_data-lake.tf` as a sample for what `source` should look like when referencing an external module._
- [ ] Rerun terraform apply and note the error message.
- [ ] Rerun terraform init and then run terraform apply again.
- [ ] In the web browser, browse to your new airflow instance.
